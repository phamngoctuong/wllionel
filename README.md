# Laravel in WordPress Theme

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. It's one of the most popular PHP frameworks today.

Laraish brings the Laravel Framework into WordPress, which allow us to have all the benefits of Laravel. So you can create themes with less effort, more enjoyment!

## Requirement

The 99% of Laraish is just the regular full stack PHP Framework [Laravel](https://laravel.com/). So if you have never heard of it, you're going to want to take a look at it before you can go any further.

For those who are already familiar with Laravel, it should be a piece of cake for you to get started with Laraish.


## What Laraish is and is not

**Laraish is not a framework for general purpose WordPress theme development.**

Yes, it is a framework but not for general WordPress theme development. Laraish is aimed at helping create "homemade theme" rather than general purpose theme. So if you want to create themes with a bunch of theme options for sales or just for free distribution, you probably want to take a look at the following frameworks instead.

* [Piklist](https://piklist.com/product/piklist/)
* [Gantry](http://gantry.org/)
* [Unyson](http://unyson.io/)


## What's the difference between the original Laravel?

I'd say almost no differences there, except some additional tweaking, which gets Laravel to work well inside a WordPress theme. So basically you could do anything that you could do with Laravel, it's just the regular Laravel inside a WordPress theme. If you are curious about what exactly have been modified, taking a diff to the original Laravel would make sense for you.


# Get Started

## Installation

You can install Laraish by issuing the following command via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

```shell script
composer create-project --prefer-dist laraish/laraish <theme-name>
```

Note that **the MySQL server and the web server must be running before you can issue the `composer create-project` command** to install Laraish. Because after Composer finishes the installation, it's going to run an artisan command, which requires MySQL server and the web server that host the WordPress be running at the time you issuing the command.

Also, notice that if you are on Mac and use MAMP or similar application to create your local server environment you may need to change your `$PATH` environment variable to make Composer use the PHP binary that MAMP provides rather than the OS's built-in PHP binary.

## Routing
Laraish replaced the original `UriValidator`(`Illuminate\Routing\Matching\UriValidator`) with its own one to allow you to specify WordPress specific routes, like "archive" or "page" or "custom post type" ex.

You define your **WordPress-specific-routes** in the `routes/wp.php` file.

For example:

```php
use App\Http\Controllers\Wp\Home;
use App\Http\Controllers\Wp\Page;
use App\Http\Controllers\Wp\Post;
use App\Http\Controllers\Wp\NotFound;
use Laraish\Support\Facades\WpRoute;

// Regular post pages
WpRoute::post('post', [Post::class, 'index']);

// Post pages where post-type is 'movie'
WpRoute::post('movie', [Post::class, 'index']);

// The archive page of "movie" post type.
WpRoute::postArchive('movie', [Home::class, 'index']);

// The child page "works" of the "about" page.
WpRoute::page('about.works', [Page::class, 'index']);

// Any child pages of the "about" page.
WpRoute::page('about.*', [Page::class, 'index']);

// Any descendant pages of the "about" page.
WpRoute::page('about.**', [Page::class, 'index']);

// The "about" page ("about" is the slug of the page)
WpRoute::page('about', [Page::class, 'index']);

// The archive page of "foobar" term of "category" taxonomy.
WpRoute::taxonomy('category.foobar', [Home::class, 'index']);

// The archive page of "category" taxonomy.
WpRoute::taxonomy('category', [Home::class, 'index']);

// The archive page of author "jack".
WpRoute::author('jack', [Home::class, 'index']);

// The archive page for all authors.
WpRoute::author([Home::class, 'index']);

// The search result page
WpRoute::search([Home::class, 'index']);

// All pages
WpRoute::page([Page::class, 'index']);

// The home/front page.
WpRoute::home([Home::class, 'index']);

// All archive pages.
WpRoute::archive([Home::class, 'index']);

// The 404 page.
WpRoute::notFound([NotFound::class, 'index']);
```

Here are some notes you should keep in mind.

* You can use a "dot notation" to specify the hierarchy for pages and taxonomies.
* You can use the wild card to specify any child/descendant page/term of a parent/ancestor page/term.
* You should care about the order of your routes. Routes that has a higher specificity should be placed more above than the routes that have a lower specificity.

### Route order
The position of the route is very **important**.

Here is a bad example:

```php
use App\Http\Controllers\Wp\Page;
use Laraish\Support\Facades\WpRoute;

WpRoute::page([Page::class, 'index']);
WpRoute::page('works', [Page::class, 'works']);
```

The problem of this code is that the second route will never get matched.
Because the first route matches to any pages, so all routes after the first one will be simply ignored.
That is, routes that has a higher specificity should be placed above the routes that have a lower specificity.

### Auto-Discovery Routing
If you don't like to specify a route manually, you could always use the auto-discovery strategy instead.
By turning on auto discovery routing, Laraish resolves the controller or view automatically the way similar to WordPress.

#### Use Auto-Discovery Routing in the route file.
```php
use App\Http\Controllers\Wp\Home;
use App\Http\Controllers\Wp\Page;
use Laraish\Support\Facades\WpRoute;

WpRoute::home([Home::class, 'index']);
WpRoute::page([Page::class, 'index']);

// Fallback to auto discovery routing.
WpRoute::autoDiscovery();
```

Notice that you should always place auto discovery routing in the last line of your route file.

With this featured turned on, Laraish will try to find a controller or view that matches to the following naming convention.

in the `<ViewRoot>/wp` directory:

- home.blade.php
- search.blade.php
- archive.blade.php
- post.blade.php
- post
    - {$post_type}.blade.php
- post-archive
    - {$post_type}.blade.php
- page.blade.php
- page
    - {$page_slug}.blade.php
    - {$page_slug}
        - {$child_page}.blade.php
        - …
- template
    - {$template_slug}.blade.php
- taxonomy.blade.php
- taxonomy
    - {$taxonomy}.blade.php
    - {$taxonomy}
        - {$term}.blade.php
        - {$term}
            - {$child_term}.blade.php
            - …
- author.blade.php
    - {$nicename}.blade.php

Same rule applied to the controllers under the namespace `App\Http\Controllers\Wp`.

For example, If the coming request is for a page called "foo", it'll try to : 

1. Find a controller action in the following order.
    * `App\Http\Controllers\Wp\Page\Foo@index`.
    * `App\Http\Controllers\Wp\Page@index`.
2. If no controller action found, try to find a view file in the following order (if any, pass the `$post` object as the view data).
    * `<ViewRootDir>/wp/page/foo.blade.php`.
    * `<ViewRootDir>/wp/page.blade.php`.

As you can see, the searching paths will follow the hierarchy of the queried object.
In the above example queried object is the page `foo`. Same rule will be applied to taxonomy or post archive Etc.

If Laraish could resolve the route, it'll passes some default view data according to the type of queried object :

* **page**
    * `$post`
* **post archive**
    * `$posts`
* **taxonomy archive**
    * `$term`
    * `$posts`
* **home**
    * `$post` if it's a "frontpage", otherwise `$posts`

Where `$post` is a Post [model](#models) object, and `$posts` is a `Laraish\Support\Wp\Query\QueryResults` object contains a collection of posts.

By default, the post model will be `Laraish\Support\Wp\Model\Post`, but it'll try to locate a custom model in `\App\Models\Wp\Post` first.

For example, if the queried object is a custom post type "movie", it will try to use `\App\Models\Wp\Post\Movie` if such a class found.
Same rule applied to the taxonomy too, but the searching path will be `\App\Models\Wp\Taxonomy` instead.

Notice that if you want to use template for pages or posts, you should register them in [theme.php](https://github.com/laraish/laraish/blob/master/config/theme.php#L167-L176).

#### Use Auto-Discovery Routing in the Controller.
Not only in the route file, you could also use the `resolveView` method in the controller to let Laraish resolve the view file automatically.

Here is an example shows how you can use utilize the `resolveView` in a controller.

In the `routes/wp.php` file :

```php
use App\Http\Controllers\Wp\Page;
use Laraish\Support\Facades\WpRoute;

WpRoute::page([Page::class, 'index']);
```

In the controller :

```php
namespace App\Http\Controllers\Wp;

use App\Http\Controllers\Controller;

class Page extends Controller
{
    public function index()
    {
        $data = [ 'foo' => 'bar' ];
        
        // Let Laraish figure out the view file.
        // 'wp.page' is the default view if no matched view found. 
        return $this->resolveView('wp.page', $data);
    }
}
```

In the above example, if the coming request is for a page called "foo", it'll try to find a view file from the following paths:

* `<ViewRootDir>/wp/page/foo.blade.php`.
* `<ViewRootDir>/wp/page.blade.php`.

### Regular Route
Alone with the WordPress routes, you can even write your own routes by URI, and it just works.
Just be careful do not write regular routes to the `routes/wp.php` file ( technically you could, but I would not recommend ).
For instance, write them to the `routes/web.php` file. 

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

// This will use the original UriValidator of Laravel.
Route::get('/my/endpoint', function () {
    return 'Magic!';
});
```

Keep in mind that routes in `routes/wp.php` has the lowest priority of all the routes in the `routes` directory.

## Models
Laraish comes with some general purpose models like `Post` or `Term` model. Note that they are not an implementation of ORM like the Laravel's Eloquent Model. They are just a simple wrapper for WordPress's APIs that encapsulate some common logic to help you simplify your business logic. 

You can find those models in `Laraish\Support\Wp\Model`. Because the `Post` model is the most frequently used model, for convenience, a `Post` Class that extends the `Laraish\Support\Wp\Model\Post` has brought to your `app/Models` directory already.

Let's take a look at an example. 

Say you have a route like this :

```php
WpRoute::archive('\App\Http\Controllers\Wp\Archive@index');
```

In your controller `app\Http\Controllers\Wp\Archive` :

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers\Wp;

use App\Http\Controllers\Controller;
use App\Models\Post;

class Archive extends Controller
{
    public function index()
    {
        $data = [
            'posts' => Post::queriedPosts() // get the posts for current page
        ];

        return $this->view('wp.archive', $data);
    }
}
```

In your view `wp.archive` :

```blade
<main class="posts">
    @foreach($posts as $post)
        <section class="post">
            <a class="post" href="{{ $post->permalink }}">
                <img class="post__thumbnail" src="{{ $post->thumbnail->url }}" alt="{{ $post->title }}">
            </a>
            <time class="post__time" datetime="{{ $post->dateTime }}">{{ $post->date }}</time>
            <a class="post__category" href="{{ $post->category->url }}">{{ $post->category->name }}</a>
            <h1 class="post__title">{{ $post->title }}</h1>
        </section>
    @endforeach

    {{  $posts->getPagination() }}
</main>
```

As you can see in the example above, you can get common properties of a post, like `$post->permalink` or `$post->title` etc. 

Actually, those `properties` are not "real properties". When you access property like `$post->permalink`, under the hood, it'll call `$post->permalink()` to get the value for you automatically, and from the second time when you access the same property, it won't call `$post->permalink()` again, instead, it'll return the cached value from previous calling result. If you don't want to use cached value, you can call the method explicitly like `$post->title()`.

Also, feel free to create your own "properties" by adding public methods to your model class.

Take a look at [Laraish\Support\Wp\Model](https://github.com/laraish/framework/tree/master/Support/Wp/Model), there are some predefined "properties" that you may want to use. 

### Cast Model to JSON
As I mentioned earlier, models that comes with Laraish are not real models.
If you want to cast a "model" to JSON, you must specify the attributes you want output in the `$visible` property.

For example:

```php
<?php
namespace App\Models;

use Laraish\Support\Wp\Model\Post as BaseModel;

class Post extends BaseModel
{
    protected $visible = [
        'title',
        'thumbnail',
        'content'
    ];
}
```

Now you can call `$post->toJson()` to get the serialized json string of the post object.

## The `@loop` blade directive
Laraish also added a `@loop` blade directive for simplifying "[The Loop](https://codex.wordpress.org/The_Loop)" in WordPress.

for example:

```blade
@loop($posts as $post)
	{{ get_the_title() }}
@endloop
```

will be compiled to

```php
<?php foreach($posts as $post): setup_the_post( $post->wpPost ); ?>
                
    <?php echo e(get_the_title()); ?>

<?php endforeach; wp_reset_postdata(); ?>
```

where `$post` should be a `Post` model object.

Usually you don't want to use the `@loop` directive. Because it'll introduce some unnecessary overheads. Keep in mind that always prefer `@foreach` to `@loop`. Except you want to access some properties like `content` or `excerpt` which requiring must be retrieved within "The Loop", otherwise never use the `@loop` actively.


## Theme Options
Setup the custom post type, register the navigation menus ... There always are some common tasks you have to deal with when you start to build a WordPress theme. The `app/config/theme.php` is where you define all your common tasks. 

Some basic options are predefined for you. Take a look at the [config/theme.php](https://github.com/laraish/laraish/blob/master/config/theme.php).

Also, you can create your own options by adding new static methods to the `App\Providers\ThemeOptionsProvider`. The name of the method will become to an option.


## Actions and Filters
You define your actions and filters in `App\Providers\EventServiceProvider` just like the laravel's event.

The following example adding a `pre_get_posts` action, and the `handle` method of `App\Listeners\MainQueryListener` will be called for this action.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Providers;

use Laraish\Foundation\Support\Providers\EventServiceProvider as ServiceProvider;

class EventServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    /**
     * Register the WordPress actions
     * @var array
     */
    protected $action = [
            'pre_get_posts' => 'App\Listeners\MainQueryListener'
    ];

    /**
     * Register the WordPress filters
     * @var array
     */
    protected $filter = [];
}
```


## Pagination
You can get the pagination by calling the `getPagination` method of `Post`.

```php
use App\Models\Post;

$posts = Post::queriedPosts();
```

```html
<div>
	{{  $posts->getPagination() }}
</div>
```

By providing additional parameters, you can specify the view file and several options. See [laraish/pagination](https://github.com/laraish/pagination) for more details.


## Work with ACF
The model classes comes with Laraish works seamlessly with [ACF](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/) out of the box.

### Get the value of custom field from model
For example, suppose that you have created a custom field with ACF named `foobar`. Then you can access the field's value like this: 

```php
use App\Models\Post;

$post = new Post(123); 
// As with the `Post` model, these models works the same way. 
// `Laraish\Support\Wp\Model\User`
// `Laraish\Support\Wp\Model\Term` 


// This make it call the magic method to get the value of the custom field `foobar`. 
$foobar = $post->foobar;
```

### Data Type Casting
You can determine if or not or how to cast the data type retrieved from ACF at [`config/theme.php`](https://github.com/laraish/laraish/blob/master/config/theme.php#L203-L217).

The default behavior is casting any of these types to Laraish's model:

* `WP_Post` → `Laraish\Support\Wp\Model\Post`
* `WP_User` → `Laraish\Support\Wp\Model\User`
* `WP_Term` → `Laraish\Support\Wp\Model\Term`

Additionally, casting any assoc array to `stdClass`.

## The `ShareViewData` Middleware
Laraish comes with a middleware `app/Http/Middleware/ShareViewData.php`. This is your best place to define any [shared view data](https://laravel.com/docs/master/views#sharing-data-with-all-views) or [view composers](https://laravel.com/docs/master/views#view-composers). 


## Options page
Perhaps creating options pages is one of the most tedious tasks. 
If you've used the WordPress's API to create options pages, you know how dirty the code is going to be… 

Laraish provides a powerful and yet clean API to help you creating the options pages.

See [laraish/options](https://github.com/laraish/options) for more details.


## View debugger
Sometimes, you just want to get some basic information about the current view(page) being displayed. For example, the path of the view file, or the name of the controller that was used.

To get the basic information of the current view being displayed, you include the `ViewDebbuger` trait in your `App\Http\Controllers`.
Make sure you have called `wp_footer()` in your view, then open your console of your browser, and you could find something like this:

```json
{
    "view_path": "/var/www/example/wp-content/themes/example/resources/views/singular/news.blade.php",
    "compiled_path": "/var/www/example/wp-content/themes/example/storage/framework/views/befa3e2a2cb93be21c6ebf30a60824a5d2a2ed11.php",
    "data": {
        "post": {}
    },
    "controller": "App\\Http\\Controllers\\Singular\\News"
}
```

Note that when `APP_ENV=production` is set in your `.env` file, nothing will be outputted to the console.


## Run artisan command
As I mentioned in the [Installation](#installation) section. To run an artisan command, you have to meet the following conditions.

* The MySQL server and the web server must be running.
* If you are on Mac and use MAMP or similar application to create your local server environment you may need to change your `$PATH` environment variable to make Composer use the PHP binary that MAMP provides rather than the OS's built-in PHP binary.


## Security Concerns
Notice that Laraish is just a regular WordPress theme. Therefore, not only the `public` directory but all the files and directories inside the theme are **accessible** from outside.

Laraish comes with two `.htaccess` files to deny any accesses against any files and directories inside the theme **except** the following files:

* `style.css`
* `screenshot.png`
* `public/**`

If you don't use Apache, you should have your server software configured to have the same access control just like the above one.


# Known Issue

## Composer race condition
If you have a plugin using Composer, and that plugin has the same dependency as your theme(Laraish) has, may lead to a problem when they are using a different version of that dependency.

In such a situation, it'll `require` multiple Composer Autoloaders(`vendor/autoload.php`), and **the last loaded one will take priority over the previous ones**.

Say you have a plugin that depends on the package `Foo (v1.2.0)`, and your theme depends on the same package `Foo (v2.0.1)`; such a situation may lead to load the unintended version of `Foo`. Which version will be used depend on the time the `autoloader.php` was loaded and the time the package(class) was used.

Being that said, this is not a Composer specific issue. I'd say it's a WordPress issue that needs to be solved somehow.

Here are some articles discussing this issue in WordPress.

* [A Narrative of Using Composer in a WordPress Plugin](https://wptavern.com/a-narrative-of-using-composer-in-a-wordpress-plugin)
* [PHP Scoper: How to Avoid Namespace Issues in your Composer Dependencies](https://deliciousbrains.com/php-scoper-namespace-composer-depencies/)

If you are planing to publish this theme for general use, make sure you have your theme namespaced by using tools like [PHP Scoper](https://github.com/humbug/php-scoper).
